# Student Grades Calculator
This Python program allows users to input the names and grades of multiple students, calculate individual average grades, assign letter grades based on those averages, and compute the overall class average.

## Features
- Accepts user input for the number of students and their names

- Collects 5 grades per student

- Calculates each student's average grade

- Assigns a letter grade (Aâ€“F) based on the average

- Computes and displays the class average


## How it works
1. The program prompts the user to enter how many students will be graded.

2. For each student, the user inputs their name and five grades.

3. The script stores the data in a dictionary.

4. It loops through each student to:

    Calculate their average grade

    Determine their letter grade

    Display the results

5. Finally, it calculates the class average by averaging all student averages.
